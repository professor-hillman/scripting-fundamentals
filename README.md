# Scripting Fundamentals - Development Environment

Welcome to the course! This repository contains the development environment and starter materials for our Scripting Fundamentals class. Follow the instructions below to create your own personal copy of this repository and set up your coding environment.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Step 1: Create Your Personal Repository

**Important:** Do NOT clone this repository directly. Instead, create your own copy by using it as a template.

1. **Click the green "Use this template" button** at the top right of this page
2. **Select "Create a new repository"** from the dropdown menu
3. **Configure your new repository:**
   - **Owner:** Select your GitHub account
   - **Repository name:** Give your repo a name like: `lbcc-scripting`
   - **Visibility:** Choose **Private** (recommended) or P.g., `cosn-206-f2025-hillman`)
   - **Description:** (Optional) "My coursework for Scriptiublic
   - **Leave "Include all branches" unchecked**
4. **Click "Create repository"**

You now have your own personal copy of the course repository! All your work will be saved here.

### Step 2: Launch Your Development Environment

We'll use GitHub Codespaces to give you a fully-configured Python development environment in your browser - no installation required!

1. **In YOUR new repository** (not this template), click the green **"Code"** button
2. **Click the "Codespaces" tab**
3. **Click "Create codespace on main"**
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for your environment to build (first time only)

Your browser-based VS Code environment will open automatically!

### Step 3: Verify Your Environment

Once your Codespace opens, test that everything is working:

1. **Open the Terminal** (it should open automatically at the bottom)
2. **Run these commands:**

```bash
python --version
```

You should see Python 3.x displayed.
